## this is my todo list for myself

## Ideal Functionality

## * Input todos(Due Date, Duration, materials) -> Progress Checkin, Scheduled Time to work on 
    ## Based on how much time it takes the due date and other tasks
    ## And giving me still time to have fun. 
    ## I would like a way to send this to my phone
    ## Find time in between my schedule to do task
    ## Update progress on task
    ## A way to change the due date
    
    ## At beginning (can this be done at work or somewhere else)
## * Close them out when task is done
