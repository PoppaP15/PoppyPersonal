class events:

    ## I need to have something to prompt me to do in preparation to this event
    ## make seperate .py file for events
    ## maybe have a calendar that I can input events into and it will prompt me to do things
    ## like if I have a wedding in 2 months it will prompt me to get a gift, get a dress, get a hotel room, etc
