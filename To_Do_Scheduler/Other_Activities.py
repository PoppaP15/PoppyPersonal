    ## this can be like gym, writing, or things that I want to do that don't necessarily have to
    ## be done but I want to make sure I have time for them
    ## maybe have a way to input how often I want to do these things and it will schedule them in
    ## like if I want to go to the gym 3 times a week it will find time in my schedule to do that
    ## make seperate .py file for other activities
